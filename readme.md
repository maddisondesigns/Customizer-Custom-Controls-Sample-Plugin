## Description ##

This is a sample plugin to show how to implement my Customizer Custom Controls (and the core default controls). My Customizer Controls can be found at [https://github.com/maddisondesigns/customizer-custom-controls](https://github.com/maddisondesigns/customizer-custom-controls).

This example plugin shows how to incorporate Customizer functionality into your plugin, including examples of how to create Panels, Sections and how to update the Live Preview window. As well as showing the usage of the (built-in) core controls, there are also a number of Custom Controls, the details of which can be found in the abovementioned repo.

The example code in /inc/customizer.php will:  

- Creates a new Panel in the Customizer called **Header & Navigation** which contains three sections (Social Icons, Contact & Search).  
- Creates a new section called **Sample Custom Controls** which contains examples of all the custom controls I created.  
- Creates a new section called **Default Controls** which contains examples of all the core controls that are included in WordPress.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the 'simple-custom-controls' folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Appearance > Widgets' screen and insert the 'Simple Inline SVG' widget into one of your sidebars
