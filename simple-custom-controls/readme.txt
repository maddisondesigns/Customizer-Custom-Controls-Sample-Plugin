A simple plugin to show how to use my Customizer Custom Controls within a plugin

== Description ==

This is a sample plugin to show how to implement my Customizer Custom Controls (and the core default controls). My Customizer Controls can be found at [https://github.com/maddisondesigns/customizer-custom-controls](https://github.com/maddisondesigns/customizer-custom-controls).

This example theme shows how to incorporate Customizer functionality into your theme (or plugin), including examples of how to create Panels, Sections and how to update the Live Preview window. As well as showing the usage of the (built-in) core controls, there are also a number of Custom Controls, the details of which can be found in the abovementioned repo.

The example code in /inc/customizer.php will:

- Creates a new Panel in the Customizer called Header & Navigation which contains three sections (Social Icons, Contact & Search).
- Creates a new section called Sample Custom Controls which contains examples of all the custom controls I created.
- Creates a new section called Default Controls which contains examples of all the core controls that are included in WordPress.
- Creates a new section called WooCommerce Layout with sample controls if the WooCommerce plugin is activat
